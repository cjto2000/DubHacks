We created the website Free News for the Dubhacks Hackathon 2019.

This website allows users to choose a news site to browse a topic on and automatically
compares the article from their chosen site to an article from a politically differing
source. The purpose of this website was to show users the biases in media and try to
mitigate these biases by displaying two different news sources simultaneously.
